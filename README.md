# Li-Fi-Based-Under-Water-Communication
Li-Fi uses ultra-fast LED light pulses to transmit data, offering speeds over 10 Gbps and a spectrum 10,000× larger than RF. It’s secure, EMI-free, and safe for hospitals, aircraft, and nuclear sites. Though short-range and costly, Li-Fi can outperform Wi-Fi and enable IoT links using light-based communication.
